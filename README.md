Using a Linked-List, List, and List Iterator to create a Stout List that is a doubly Linked List with dummy node at the head and tail
  
null <- |head| <-> |tail| -> null    Empty StoutList

Worked with Linked-List and adding/removing from them
- resetting head and tail pointers to add and remove

Uses list iterator to traverse through your list and to make changes as needed
